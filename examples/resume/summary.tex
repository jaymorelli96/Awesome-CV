As a Go Software Engineer with Siemens, I’ve been an integral part of the Industrial Edge project, actively influencing processes, enhancing documentation, and contributing to internal libraries. My expertise spans diverse areas, making me a well‑rounded software engineer who stands out from conventional developers, thanks to my passion and soft skills.

I thrive on sharing knowledge and experiences with colleagues, and I am trying to actively contribute to open‑source projects. I am most at ease in the terminal: I am an avid supporter of Vim and Linux, constantly customizing my environment to achieve the most optimal workflow. My commitment to continuous growth is evident through my enthusiasm for learning and consistently building new projects.

As a dedicated professional, I bring a unique blend of technical proficiency, collaborative spirit, and a genuine passion for innovation. I am eager to contribute my skills and drive for excellence.

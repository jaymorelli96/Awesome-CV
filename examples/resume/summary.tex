As a Tech Lead and Software Engineer at Siemens, I have been an integral part of the Industrial Edge project, actively influencing processes, contributing to architectural decisions, developing internal libraries, and enhancing internal documentation. My role involves significant cross-team collaboration and contribution. As a tech lead, I provide technical guidance, engage in pair programming, and act as a gatekeeper for quality and standards.

I thrive on sharing knowledge and assisting my colleagues, driven by a passionate and dedicated approach to my work. I believe this passion is my strongest trait and sets me apart. With a unique blend of technical proficiency, collaborative spirit, and a genuine drive for innovation, I am eager to contribute my skills and strive for excellence in every project.

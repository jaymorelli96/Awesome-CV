My role involves significant cross-team collaboration, including bi-weekly architectural syncs with the software architect, where I am always vocal and eager to discuss and share technical topics.

I am impressed by the company's vision and the potential impact it can have in the industry.

I am inspired by c/side's vision and eager to contribute my technical expertise to help realize this important mission.
